    Default eval wrapper: low-resolution (224x224) RGB observations.

    Camera resolution and modalities are declared via :meth:`camera_spec` and baked into the robot
    config at env CREATION by the BatchedEvaluator
    (see ``omnigibson.eval.evaluator.BatchedEvaluator.load_env``),
    not changed at runtime. This is required because in multi-env mode robot cameras are batched into
    a single ``TiledVisionSensor`` whose resolution is fixed at creation, so a post-hoc per-sensor
    resize would be silently ignored.

        env (og.Environment): The environment to wrap.
