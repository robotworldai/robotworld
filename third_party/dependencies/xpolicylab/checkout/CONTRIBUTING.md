# Contributing a Policy to XPolicyLab

This page is the submission standard for `policy/<POLICY>/` adapters: what a complete adapter contains, how to test it, and what a PR must include. For repo-wide concepts and workflows, see the [README](README.md).

Two bundled Agent Skills automate most of this: `xpolicylab-model-integration` builds an adapter, `xpolicylab-adapter-check` audits one before a PR. They live in `.agents/skills/`, which `.cursor/skills` and `.claude/skills` symlink to, so Cursor, Claude Code and Codex all pick them up. [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) distills this page into the always-on rules every agent must follow; `CLAUDE.md` just imports it.

## Adapter Standard

### Files

Scaffold with `bash scripts/create_policy.sh <POLICY>` (copies `policy/demo_policy/`), then keep:

```text

```

`process_data.sh` / `train.sh` may be omitted only for an agreed **eval-only** submission: state it in the PR, notify the maintainers ([Contact](README.md#-contact)), and give a timeline for open-sourcing training.

### `model.py`

Define `class Model(ModelTemplate)` (`from XPolicyLab.model_template import ModelTemplate`):

| Method | Contract |
| --- | --- |
| `__init__(model_cfg)` | `model_cfg` is `deploy.yml` merged with per-run overrides (`ckpt_name`, `action_type`, `env_cfg_type`, `seed`, ...). Load checkpoints and processors here. |
| `update_obs(obs)` / `update_obs_batch(obs_list)` | Store observation dict(s) for the next action call. |
| `get_action()` | Return one action chunk: `list[dict]` of numpy arrays. |
| `get_action_batch(env_idx_list=None)` | Batched chunks aligned with active env indices. |
| `reset()` | Clear model state between episodes. |

Action dictionaries use the standard keys (`left_arm_joint_state`, `right_ee_joint_state`, `ee_pose`, ...) with dimensions taken from `get_robot_action_dim_info(env_cfg_type)` in `XPolicyLab.utils.process_data` — never hard-coded, and never through a private re-implementation of the lookup. `env_cfg/` lives in the parent workspace, outside this checkout, so an adapter that assembles that path itself gets it wrong. Observation and trajectory formats: README, [Standard Data Formats](README.md#-standard-data-formats).

A new robot must be registered in **both** robot-info files, or training and evaluation will disagree about action dimensions:

| File | Read by | Keyed by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `<parent>/env_cfg/robot/_robot_info.json` | `get_robot_action_dim_info()` and `get_action_dim()` in `XPolicyLab.utils.process_data` — runtime and offline conversion | robot name, from `config.robot` in `<parent>/env_cfg/<env_cfg_type>.yml` |
| `utils/robot/_robot_info.json` | `utils/get_action_dim.sh`, called by `train.sh` | `env_cfg_type` |

Two entry points share the name `get_action_dim`, and they do **not** read the same file. Runtime and conversion code imports `get_action_dim` (or `get_robot_action_dim_info`) from `XPolicyLab.utils.process_data`. The training path — `train.sh`, or a Python training entry it invokes — uses `utils/get_action_dim.sh` instead: it delivers the value as a shell variable, runs on stdlib `json` alone (importing the Python module pulls in numpy, cv2, h5py and yaml), and works in a standalone checkout that has no outer `env_cfg/` tree.

Two more shared entry points, so adapters do not re-derive them: the importable root in `policy/<POLICY>/model.py` is `Path(__file__).resolve().parents[2]` (the parent of this checkout — `parents[1]` or `parents[3]` is a bug), and checkpoint directories resolve through `XPolicyLab.utils.checkpoint_resolver` (`resolve_checkpoint_root`, or `build_run_dir_name` / `candidate_checkpoint_roots` when the adapter adds its own naming layer).

`model.py` never decodes images. The policy server decodes every observation it forwards, so `obs["vision"][<camera>]["color"]` is always a plain image array. This holds for `update_obs` / `update_obs_batch` and for any custom RPC a policy exposes that carries an observation, so an adapter with its own deploy loop still must not decode.

In offline code — conversion scripts and training dataloaders that read trajectory files — **only `decode_image_bit` from `XPolicyLab.utils.process_data` is supported**. Never hand-roll `cv2.imdecode` / `np.frombuffer` / PIL decoding. Image bits carry some inconsistency from earlier data versions: a PIL-style decode returns reversed channels, and hand-rolled buffer handling breaks on the older layouts. Only this function covers every version and returns RGB. The README states the rule in [Standard Data Formats](README.md#decode-only-through-decode_image_bit).

Images are RGB end to end. `decode_image_bit` returns RGB — treat this as settled and do not re-derive it from the usual "OpenCV returns BGR" rule, which does not apply here: XPolicyLab buffers are encoded from RGB arrays, and `cv2.imencode` / `cv2.imdecode` move channels through JPEG in the order they were given, so the round trip is RGB in, RGB out. No channel conversion belongs in conversion, training, or eval code. Two exceptions: medium adapters — `COLOR_RGB2BGR` immediately before `cv2.VideoWriter.write(...)` and `COLOR_BGR2RGB` immediately after `cv2.VideoCapture.read()` — and a deliberate RGB→BGR conversion for a checkpoint trained on BGR data, which must be opt-in through a documented `deploy.yml` key that defaults to RGB (see `policy/Dexora_1B`'s `input_color_order`). A `cv2.cvtColor(decode_image_bit(...), COLOR_BGR2RGB)` anywhere means training and evaluation disagree on channel order.

### `deploy.yml`

`policy_name` must equal the directory name — the server imports `XPolicyLab.policy.<policy_name>.model`, and the setup scripts derive the name from the directory. Keep `protocol: ws` (`legacy_tcp` is for unmigrated legacy adapters only). Per-run fields are overridden by the setup scripts; put stable defaults here. Reference (`policy/demo_policy/deploy.yml`):

```yaml
policy_name: demo_policy
protocol: ws
host: localhost
port: null
bench_name: null
task_name: null
ckpt_name: null
env_cfg_type: null
seed: null
action_type: null
gpu_id: null
eval_batch: false
```

All of these are required except `ckpt_name` and `gpu_id`, which the setup scripts supply per run. Keep a key even when a script already defaults it, and document model-specific extra keys in the policy README.

### Scripts

All adapters share the same entry-point conventions (argument meanings: README, [Common Workflow](README.md#-common-workflow)):

```bash
bash eval.sh <bench_name> <task_name> <ckpt_name> <env_cfg_type> <action_type> <seed> \
  <policy_gpu_id> <env_gpu_id> <policy_env_or_uv_path> <eval_env_conda_env>
```

`eval.sh` starts the policy server, waits for it, runs the environment client, and cleans up — keep it aligned with `policy/demo_policy/eval.sh`; document any extra arguments in the policy README. Checkpoints resolve to `checkpoints/<bench_name>-<ckpt_name>-<env_cfg_type>-<action_type>-<seed>/` unless the policy README documents another layout.

### Policy README

All policy READMEs share one template — [policy/demo_policy/README.md](policy/demo_policy/README.md) is the minimal reference, [policy/AHA_WAM/README.md](policy/AHA_WAM/README.md) shows a complex adapter (model assets, custom environment variables):

1. **Header**: `**Contributor:** ... | **Paper:** ... | **arXiv:** ... | **Original code:** ...`, then 1–3 sentences on the model and what the adapter supports; mention vendored upstream directories here.
2. **Pointer paragraph** (verbatim): shared conventions link to the root README, official results link to the [RoboDojo LeaderBoard](https://robodojo-benchmark.com/LeaderBoard).
3. **Sections in order**: `Installation`, `Data Processing`, `Training`, `Evaluation`, plus `Model Assets` / `Configuration` / `Notes` only when the adapter needs them. State explicitly when a stage is unsupported (eval-only, upstream-native data, ...).
4. **Policy-specific content only**: one command template plus one runnable example per stage, extra arguments, required environment variables, `deploy.yml` keys, checkpoint-layout deviations. Do not restate shared argument tables or the split-machine flow — link to the root README instead.

## Testing

Run these in order before opening a PR.

**1. Static checks** (repo root):

```bash
bash -n policy/<POLICY>/*.sh
python -m py_compile policy/<POLICY>/model.py policy/<POLICY>/deploy.py
```

XPolicyLab data supports only `decode_image_bit` (README, [Standard Data Formats](README.md#decode-only-through-decode_image_bit)). The first grep must return nothing on adapter-owned conversion and training code; vendor files that never see XPolicyLab trajectories can be skipped, but a `cv2.imdecode` on those trajectories is a fail. The second grep surfaces channel swaps that need judging (medium adapters and a documented `input_color_order` are the only allowed hits):

```bash
# only decode_image_bit is supported
grep -rnE 'cv2\.imdecode|np\.frombuffer|Image\.open' policy/<POLICY>/
# channel swaps — judge each hit
grep -rnE 'COLOR_BGR2RGB|COLOR_RGB2BGR|\.\.\., ::-1' policy/<POLICY>/
```

**2. Debug closed loop** — no simulator needed; verifies imports, server startup, observation serialization, action keys and dimensions, and batch logic:

```bash
cd policy/<POLICY>
export EVAL_ENV_TYPE=debug
bash eval.sh RoboDojo stack_bowls <ckpt_name> arx_x5 joint 0 0 0 <policy_env> base
```

The run must reach `[MAIN] eval finished` with no tracebacks.

**3. Simulator evaluation** — recommended for every PR and required before a leaderboard entry is published: run the same `eval.sh` with `EVAL_ENV_TYPE=sim` (or unset) inside a RoboDojo / RoboTwin workspace and record task success rates.

## PR Standard

Title: `[policy] <POLICY>: <short summary>`, e.g. `[policy] FastWAM: add RoboDojo adapter`.

Every submission PR must include the adapter following the standard above, a working policy README, and test evidence. For **official leaderboard evaluation** ([RoboDojo](https://robodojo-benchmark.com/LeaderBoard), [RoboTwin](https://robotwin-platform.github.io/leaderboard)), the PR description must also carry a checkpoint download script — Hugging Face or ModelScope preferred — so we can reproduce your results; we evaluate and publish entries as soon as possible.
